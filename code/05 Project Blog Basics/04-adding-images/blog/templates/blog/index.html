            <p>
              There's nothing like the views you get when hiking in the
              mountains! And I wasn't even prepared for what happened whilst I
              was enjoying the view!

  <h2>What I Do</h2>
  <p>
    I love programming, I love to help others and I enjoy exploring new
    technologies in general!
  </p>
  <p>
    My goal is to keep on growing as a developer - and if I could help you do
    the same, I'd be very happy!
